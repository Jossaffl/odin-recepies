        <p>We're giving creamy chicken soup a complete update for the modern slow cooker era!</p>
        <p>Instead of just some chicken, mushrooms, and cream, we're adding in carrots, celery, spinach and some rice.</p>
        <p>As well as the cream and the mushrooms. But we're pan-searing the mushrooms with some rosemary and butter!</p>
        <p>Just a little indulgent for when we need to practice the most amount of self-care but also need to keep it healthy!</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

        <ul>    
            <li>Chicken breast- boneless and skinless.</li>
            <li>Mushrooms- brown chestnut mushrooms because they have a deeper flavour.</li>
            <li>Onion, carrots & celery- the trio that starts off every amazing flavour filled soup! We throw in some garlic too because there's always room for garlic!</li>
            <li>Basmati rice- the rice does so many things here. Helps to bulk out this soup when you're trying to stretch your budget. It also brings creaminess and flavour to the soup.</li>
            <li>Chicken stock from a stock cube- you can use vegetable stock here too.</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs- rosemary, thyme and parsley. In a pinch, you can use dried rosemary and thyme, but I very much suggest fresh parsley for the finished soup.</li>
            <li>Single cream- we're only using 300ml for the whole soup, so yes. This soup is still very healthy!</li>
        </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the chicken into chunks and if you have a "cook and sear" slow cooker then place it on the hob with some olive oil and brown the chicken.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is browned now you can add in the carrots, celery, onion, rice and thyme leaves.</li>
            <li> Make the chicken or vegetable stock using the stock cube and about 1.25l of boiling water. If you're feeling fancy you can use two stock cubes here.</li>
            <li>Pour in the hot stock and cook on a high heat setting for about 3 hours. The rice will be tender but then and starting to soak up some of the broth so your soup will be very thick.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through turn off the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Pour in the cream and add in the spinach. Give everything a really good stir and replace the lid back on the slow cooker to wilt the spinach.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, quarter the mushrooms and heat the nonstick pan on high heat.</li>
            <li>Add some olive oil to the pan, add in the mushrooms and sear until the mushrooms are golden.</li>
            <li>Add in some butter and the chopped rosemary. Once the mushrooms are golden, add them to the slow cooker along with the browned butter and rosemary.</li>
        </ol>
